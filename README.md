# Ticket Sorter Library

This PHP library sorts travel tickets and generates itineraries for a given set of travel tickets. It is designed to be used as part of a larger PHP application.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository from the [Ticket Sorter GitHub repo](https://github.com/HammadUlAhad/ticket-sorter) to your desired location on your local machine.


2. Navigate to the extracted directory:

   ```bash
   cd ticket-sorter
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Code

1. Run the `run.php` script to see a working implementation of the API:

   ```bash
   php run.php
   ```

### Running Tests

1. After installing dependencies, run PHPUnit tests:

   ```bash
   vendor\bin\phpunit
   ```

## Working Implementation of the API

The `run.php` script serves as a working implementation of the API. It demonstrates how to use the `TicketSorter` and `ItineraryGenerator` classes to sort travel tickets and generate itineraries.
